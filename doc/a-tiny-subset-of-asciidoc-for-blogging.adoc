=== Paragraph

A paragraph is a line of text that gets parsed to find inline elements.

== Inline Elements

Currently the following types are recognized:

* Strong and emphasis
* Link
* Inline code

=== Strong and Emphasis

----
a text with some *strong* words, that I’d like to _emphasize_.
----

It is possible to combine the two for the same text.

=== Link

----
Check out this https://erikwinter.nl/[awesome website] now! 
----

Whatever is between the opening bracket and the first space before that is taken as URL, so both absolute and relative links without domain are possible.

=== Inline Code

----
Some text with `code` in it.
